		\lettersection{About Me}
		
		I am applying for the position available in the company that was recently advertised on the website under the title Internship-Technology and Insights
		
		I am a fresh graduate and received my Bachelors in Computer Sciences from International Islamic University Islamabad, Pakistan with a CGPA of $\textbf{3.96/4.0}$ in 2017. I moved to Trondheim Norway in January 2018. 
		\lettersection{Why Me?}
 I had the singular honor of receiving the Presidential Gold Medal for outstanding academic achievement in my undergraduate degree. I was awarded the maximum scholarship in all semesters during my undergraduate degree program due to my excellent grades. My research paper titled \emph{A novel Cryptographic method developed towards the application of image processing} is under review in \emph{IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science}, that will be held at Oxford UK in July 2018. In this paper, we proposed a novel method which will bring state of the art understanding of Cryptographic methods in the field of image processing field.  Ranging from poetry to sports, I have left hardly any stone unturned in this respect. I was a member of my college and high school badminton and chess teams. I was also the senior most Appointment holder, both at the high school as well as in university. As a volunteer, I joined the ERRA and helped the victims of 2005 Earthquake at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences.
 
 As an enthusiastic young woman, with my strong academic and professional background, currently I am embarking myself to learn the science behind Machine Leaning/Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics through online courses on \emph{Coursera} (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). In addition to that, I have been active in integrating my programming assignments through Git platform which enable me to get feedback on my work through open source software development. I also have keen interest in the web based application development, by virtue of which I occasionally develop project through free lancing. I  believe that continued acquisition of advanced knowledge will place me in a good stead for multitude of career prospects. 

	  
\lettersection{Why Gjensidige?}
The good reputation of Gjensidige with higher employees standards, diverse cultural environment, and cutting edge research facilities have motivated me to apply for the current position. I believe this position will help me acquire versatility needed to reach my full potential as a professional researcher. I consider myself ready for the challenges of the current position, and I am sure that I will contribute very positively to your dynamic company.
